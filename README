Pre-requisites
==============

ARM toolchain
-------------

In order to cross-compile this application you need an ARM toolchain. Make sure
to add the compiler bin directory to the PATH environment variable. This can be
automated by adding

  export PATH=/path/to/toolchain/bin:$PATH

to ~/.bashrc (when using the bash shell).

Kernel Headers
--------------

To cross-compile the application against kernel headers from a kernel git tree
you first need to pre-process the headers to make them usable in userspace. This
can be done by running

  make ARCH=arm headers_install

in the kernel source directory. The headers will be installed in the
usr/include/ subdirectory of your kernel sources.

Compilation
===========

To compile the ARM software, run

  make KDIR=/path/to/kernel/sources CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

This will create the writeloader binary for ARM.
